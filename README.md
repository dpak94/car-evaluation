Evaluating a car based on various factors

Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:

| parameter | Info|
|--------|-------|
| price | buying price |
| maintenance | price of the maintenance |
|comfort | comfort |
|doors  |  number of doors |
|persons  |  capacity in terms of persons to carry |
|lug_boot  |  the size of luggage boot |
|safety | estimated safety of the car |

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
